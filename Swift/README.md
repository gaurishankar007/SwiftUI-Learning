# SwiftUI Learning Repository

This repository is dedicated to learning the SwiftUI framework for building native applications for iOS, macOS, and other Apple platforms. 

This directory focuses on the fundamental concepts of the Swift programming language, which are essential prerequisites before diving into SwiftUI application development.

## Swift Programming Language Fundamentals

*   **Variables:** Declaring and using variables and constants.
*   **Operators:** Standard arithmetic, comparison, and logical operators.
*   **If-Else:** Conditional statements for branching logic.
*   **Collections:** Working with arrays, sets, and dictionaries.
*   **Functions:** Defining and calling functions.
*   **Closures:** Understanding and using closures.
*   **Optionals:** Handling the absence of a value.
*   **Structures:** Creating custom value types.
*   **Classes:** Creating custom reference types.
*   **Enumerations:** Defining custom types with a finite set of related values.
*   **Protocols:** Defining blueprints of methods, properties, and other requirements.
*   **Extensions:** Adding new functionality to existing types.
*   **Generics:** Writing flexible and reusable code.
*   **Error Handling:** Responding to and recovering from errors.
*   **Equality & Hashing:** Conforming to `Equatable` and `Hashable` protocols.
*   **Custom Operators:** Defining custom infix, prefix, postfix, and assignment operators.
*   **Async Programming:** Understanding and using `async/await` for concurrent code.

## Next Steps: SwiftUI
